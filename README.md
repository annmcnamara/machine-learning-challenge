# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

![exoplanets.jpg](Images/exoplanets.jpg)

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data,  machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset are created in this project.

The steps are:
1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

## Processing 

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* This README reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).

## Approach
Raw light curves are constructed from the Kepler data.  Brightness values are adjusted to account for brightness variations due to the spacecrafts rotation.  These curves are processed into a more observable form and enables software to select signals that might be transit-like.  Any signal that shows potentila transit like features is calleda _threshold crossing event_.   These are tested and successful events are called KOIs (Kepler Objects of Interest). The next step is dispositioning - those that pass dispositioning are Kepler planet candidates. 

Not all the planet candidates go through this process. Circumbinary planets do not show strictly periodic transits, and have to be inspected through other methods. In addition, third-party researchers use different data-processing methods, or even search planet candidates from the unprocessed light curve data. As a consequence, those planets may be missing KOI designation.  NOTE: These planets missing KOI designation are removed from the dataset.

## Considerations
* Start by cleaning the data, removing unnecessary columns, and scaling the data.
* Not all variables are significant be sure to remove any insignificant variables.
* Make sure your `sklearn` package is up to date.
* Try a simple model first, and then tune the model using `GridSearch`.

## Submission
* A Jupyter Notebook for each model and host the notebooks on GitHub.
* A file for your best model and push to GitHub
